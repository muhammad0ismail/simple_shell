a function called _atoi that converts a string to an integer. The function works by first checking if the string is empty. If it is, the function returns 0. If the string is not empty, the function then checks if the first character of the string is a minus sign. If it is, the function sets a flag to indicate that the number is negative. The function then loops through the string, adding each digit to the result. The result is multiplied by 10 for each digit that is added. The function stops looping when it reaches the end of the string or when it encounters a non-digit character. If the flag is set, the result is multiplied by -1 before it is returned.
